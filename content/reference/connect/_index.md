Fluxnova Connect provides a simple API for connecting HTTP services and other
things. It aims at two usage scenarios: usage in a generic system such as the
Fluxnova process engine and standalone usage via API.

# Connectors

Fluxnova Connect provides a HTTP and a SOAP HTTP connector. If you want to
add an own connector to Connect please have a look at the [extending Connect]({{< ref "/reference/connect/extending-connect.md" >}})
section. This section also describes the usage of a `ConnectorConfigurator` to
configure the connector instances.

During the request invocation of a connector an interceptor chain is passed.
The user can add own interceptors to this chain. The interceptor is called for
every request of this connector.

```java
connector.addRequestInterceptor(interceptor).createRequest();
```

# Maven Coordinates

Connect can be used in any Java-based application by adding the following maven
dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

If you use other Fluxnova projects please import the
[Fluxnova BOM](/get-started/apache-maven/)
to ensure correct versions for every Fluxnova project.

Fluxnova Connect is published to [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cfluxnova-connect).

{{< note title="Process engine plugin" class="info" >}}
If you are using Connect in the Fluxnova process engine, you also need the `fluxnova-engine-plugin-connect` dependency. For more information, refer to the [Connectors guide]({{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/connectors.md" >}}).

# Logging

Fluxnova Connect uses [fluxnova-commons-logging](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/tree/master/commons/logging) which itself uses [SLF4J](http://slf4j.org) as
a logging backend. To enable logging a SLF4J implementation has to be part of
your classpath. For example `slf4j-simple`, `log4j12` or `logback-classic`.

To also enable logging for the Apache HTTP client you can use a [SLF4J
bridge](http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html) like `jcl-over-slf4j` as the Apache HTTP Client doesn't support
SLF4J.
