# Prerequisites

Before downloading Fluxnova, make sure you have a JRE (Java Runtime Environment), or better, a JDK
(Java Development Kit) installed. Please check the supported [Java versions]({{< ref "/introduction/supported-environments.md#java" >}}).

[Download JDK][get-jdk]


# Download the Runtime

Fluxnova is a flexible framework which can be used in different contexts. See [Architecture Overview]({{< ref "/introduction/architecture.md" >}}) for more details. Based on how you want
to use Fluxnova, you can choose a different distribution or runtime environment like [Spring Boot][run-with-spring-boot] or [Docker][run-with-docker].

* [Download page][community-download-page]


## Full Distribution

Download the full distribution if you want to use a [shared process engine][shared-engine] or if you
want to get to know Fluxnova quickly, without any additional setup or installation steps required.

The full distribution bundles

* Process Engine configured as [shared process engine][shared-engine],
* Runtime Web Applications (Tasklist, Cockpit, Admin),
* Rest Api,
* Container / Application Server itself.

{{< note title="Server/Container" class="info" >}}
  If you download the full distribution for an open-source application
  server/container, the container itself is included. For example, if you download the Tomcat
  distribution, Tomcat itself is included and the Fluxnova binaries (process engine and
  web apps) are pre-installed in the container. This is not true for the the Oracle WebLogic
  and IBM WebSphere downloads; these downloads do not include the application servers themselves.
