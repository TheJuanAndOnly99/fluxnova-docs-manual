Fluxnova is developed by Fluxnova as an open source project in collaboration with the community. This is the basis for the Fluxnova product provided by Fluxnova as a commercial offering.

# Community Extensions

The Fluxnova Project supports the community in its effort to build additional community extensions under the Fluxnova umbrella. Such community extensions are maintained by the community.

The [Fluxnova Community Hub](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-community-hub) is a GitHub organization that serves as the home of Fluxnova open source, community-contributed extensions. You can migrate an extension you've built to the Hub, search for existing extensions, or get started with open source by helping community extension maintainers with open issue or pull request triage.

## Building a Community Extension

Do you have a great idea around open source BPM you want to share with the world? Awesome! Fluxnova will support you in building your own community extension. Have a look at our [process for creating a new community extension](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-community-hub/community/blob/main/creating-new-extensions.md) to find out how to propose a community project.

You can also visit the Fluxnova Community Hub [community repository](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-community-hub/community) to learn more about migrating your community extension into the community hub, benefits to joining the Fluxnova Community Hub organization, contributing to an extension, and much more.

The Fluxnova Community Hub enables developers to have a centralized home for their Fluxnova community extensions, and aids new contributors to open source software in discovering new projects to work on.

You can also learn about [contributing code to the core Fluxnova codebase](https://fluxnova.finos.org/developers/how-to-contribute/).
