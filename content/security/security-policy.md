The security of Fluxnova Platform (also referred to as the 'software') takes top priority for us and is maintained constantly.

For information on our Fluxnova Security Policy, visit the [Fluxnova Trust Center](https://fluxnova.finos.org/trust-center/). 


## Penetration Testing

Fluxnova has contracted an independent, external security advisor to regularly conduct penetration tests of the software. The advisor operates according to industry best practices recommended by the OWASP organization such as the [OWASP Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/images/1/19/OTGv4.pdf). The tools used for testing include [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) and [DefenseCode Thunderscan](https://www.defensecode.com/thunderscan.php)

Any vulnerabilities detected are handled according to our [process for security issue management](https://fluxnova.finos.org/security#security-issue-management).

Further details on previously conducted security reviews on the ancestor software can be found at [Camunda 7 CE Security Policy](https://docs.camunda.org/security/security-policy/)
