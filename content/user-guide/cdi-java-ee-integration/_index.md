The `fluxnova-engine-cdi` and `fluxnova-engine-cdi-jakarta` modules provide programming model integration with CDI (Context and Dependency Injection).
CDI is the Jakarta EE/Java EE standard for Dependency Injection. The Fluxnova CDI integration leverages both the configuration of the Fluxnova engine
and the extensibility of CDI. The most prominent features are:

 * A custom El-Resolver for resolving CDI beans (including EJBs) from the process.
 * Support for `@BusinessProcessScoped` beans (CDI beans, the lifecycle of which are bound to a process instance).
 * Declarative control over a process instance using annotations.
 * The Process Engine is hooked-up to the CDI event bus.
 * Works with Jakarta EE, Java EE, and Java SE.
 * Support for unit testing.

{{< note title="Quarkus Engine Extension" class="info" >}}
Since Quarkus ArC does not aim to fully implement CDI 2.0, you cannot use the full range of features the `fluxnova-engine-cdi` module provides.
Read about the limitations in the [Quarkus Integration]({{< ref "/user-guide/quarkus-integration/cdi-integration.md#limitations" >}}) guide.
